    "GROWING UP\n\nThe essence of all growth is a willingness to change for the better and then an unremitting willingness to shoulder whatever responsibility this entails.\n\n\u2014 AS BILL SEES IT, p. 115\n\nSometimes when I've become willing to do what I should have been doing all along, I want praise and recognition. I don't realize that the more I'm willing to act differently, the more exciting my life is. The more I am willing to help others, the more rewards I receive. That's what practicing the principles means to me. Fun and benefits for me are in the willingness to do the actions, not to get immediate results. Being a little kinder, a little slower to anger, a little more loving makes my life better day by day.\n",
