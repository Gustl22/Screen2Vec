    "The research underpinning ASDetect originally began as part of a PhD commenced by Josephine Barbaro. Dr Barbaro is now the lead clinician in the Early Assessment Clinic at the Olga Tennison Autism Research Centre at La Trobe University, Melbourne, Australia. In 2006 Dr Barbaro initiated a program using 240 Maternal Child Health nurses to monitor social attention and communication behaviours in over 22,000 children aged between 12 and 24 months. \n\nIn 2013, she ran a second study of 14,000 children with 110 nurses. This developmental surveillance program for Autism Spectrum Disorders, the Social Attention and Communication Study (SACS), has been translated and disseminated widely, both within Australia and internationally. \n\nThe assessment process on which this application is based has been remarkably accurate and effective. In our studies, 81% of children who were identified as having a high likelihood for autism by Maternal Child Health nurses, did in fact have autism. Many of the remaining children who were assessed with a high likelihood had other related developmental conditions, such as language or developmental delays. \n\nYou can read both academic papers discussing the SACS here: \n\n2010 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/20495475 \n\n2013 http://www.ncbi.nlm.nih.gov/pubmed/22735682 \n\n",

    "How early is \u2018early\u2019?\n\nASDetect is designed for assessing children aged between 11 and 30 months.\n\nWhat are the benefits of using ASDetect?\n\nASDetect will provide you with a clear course of action for your next steps. Most children will show typical social and communication behaviours for their age. Some children \u2013 about 2% \u2013 will have a high likelihood of autism. The good news is that early intervention will help these children reach their full potential.\n\nIs it accurate?\n\nOver 30,000 children have been screened by 350 Maternal Child Health nurses across two large scale studies over the last 10 years. \n\nThis surveillance tool is more than seven times more accurate than the next best tool. \n\nOf the small percentage of children that nurses referred for a formal assessment, 81% had autism. \n\nWhat about my information?\n\nLa Trobe University takes your privacy very seriously. Your details are securely stored according to the La Trobe University privacy policy. For further details, please click here\n\nWhat do \u2018mostly\u2019 and \u2018rarely\u2019 mean?\n\nWe know things are never black and white, especially where children are concerned and it\u2019s the same for this application. Throughout each assessment, you will be asked whether your child, \u201cMOSTLY\u201d or \u201cRARELY\u201d displays a certain behaviour. \u201cRARELY\u201d means that although your child will sometimes display the behaviour it is not frequent, while \u201cMOSTLY\u201d means that this behaviour is frequently displayed and consistent.\n\nThis application is NOT a diagnosis or a replacement for a professional assessment. It will provide you with some guidance as to whether you should seek a developmental assessment for your child.\n\n",

And it is still dependent on getting my full paycheck, well as full as it can be since they take $140 in tax anyway (yet they still want $3000 more at the end of the year because how dare a poor person have a $14k part time job, right?). But yeah I need over $300 to book a hotel room. That's under $100/night but places here want $50 Or $100 per night cash deposit on top of paying for the room so it makes it fucking hard for me.",

I don't realize that the more I'm willing to act differently, the more exciting my life is. The more I am willing to help others, the more rewards I receive. That's what practicing the principles means to me. Fun and benefits for me are in the willingness to do the actions, not to get immediate results. Being a little kinder, a little slower to anger, a little more loving makes my life better day by day.\n",
