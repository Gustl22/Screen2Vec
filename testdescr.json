    "Bible King James Version with Apocrypha\nBook of Enoch, Jasher and Jubilees are not in Apocrypha so they are seperated in the Table of Contents and in the Search. Also they are not in Reading Plan and Daily Verses. You can remove these books: Menu->Settings->switch off \"Show Enoch/Jasher/Jubilees\"\nDaily Verse (Daily Psalm, Daily Gospel - you can make your own Daily Verse), Reading Plan (canonical) - read Bible in one Year, 180 Days, 90 Days, Audio Bible (TTS feature) and many others functions.\nThe King James Version (KJV), commonly known as the Authorized Version (AV) or King James Bible (KJB), is an English translation of the Christian Bible for the Church of England begun in 1604 and completed in 1611. First printed by the King's Printer Robert Barker, this was the third translation into English to be approved by the English Church authorities.\nJames gave the translators instructions intended to guarantee that the new version would conform to the ecclesiology and reflect the episcopal structure of the Church of England and its belief in an ordained clergy. The translation was done by 47 scholars, all of whom were members of the Church of England. In common with most other translations of the period, the New Testament was translated from Greek, the Old Testament was translated from Hebrew text, while the Apocrypha were translated from the Greek and Latin.\nThe Biblical apocrypha (from the Greek word \u1f00\u03c0\u03cc\u03ba\u03c1\u03c5\u03c6\u03bf\u03c2, ap\u00f3kruphos, meaning \"hidden\") denotes the collection of ancient books found, in some editions of the Bible, in a separate section between the Old and New Testaments or as an appendix after the New Testament. Although the term apocrypha had been in use since the 5th century, it was in Luther's Bible of 1534 that the Apocrypha was first published as a separate intertestamental section. Luther was making a polemical point about the canonicity of these books. As an authority for this division, he cited St. Jerome, who in the early 5th century distinguished the Hebrew and Greek Old Testaments, stating that books not found in the Hebrew were not received as canonical. Although his statement was controversial in his day, Jerome was later titled a Doctor of the Church and his authority was also cited in the Anglican statement in 1571 of the Thirty-Nine Articles.\nKing James Version\nThe English-language King James Version (KJV) of 1611 followed the lead of the Luther Bible in using an inter-testamental section labelled \"Books called Apocrypha\", or just \"Apocrypha\" at the running page header. The KJV followed the Geneva Bible of 1560 almost exactly (variations are marked below). The section contains the following:\n-  1 Esdras (Vulgate 3 Esdras)\n-  2 Esdras (Vulgate 4 Esdras)\n-  Tobit\n-  Judith (\"Judeth\" in Geneva)\n-  Rest of Esther (Vulgate Esther 10:4-16:24)\n-  Wisdom\n-  Ecclesiasticus (also known as Sirach)\n-  Baruch and the Epistle of Jeremy (\"Jeremiah\" in Geneva) (all part of Vulgate Baruch)\n-  Song of the Three Children (Vulgate Daniel 3:24-90)\n-  Story of Susanna (Vulgate Daniel 13)\n-  The Idol Bel and the Dragon (Vulgate Daniel 14)\n-  Prayer of Manasses (follows 2 Chronicles in Geneva)\n-  1 Maccabees\n-  2 Maccabees\nIncluded in this list are those books of the Clementine Vulgate that were not in Luther's canon. These are the books most frequently referred to by the casual appellation \"the Apocrypha\". These same books are also listed in Article VI of the Thirty-Nine Articles of the Church of England. Despite being placed in the Apocrypha, in the table of lessons at the front of some printings of the King James Bible, these books are included under the Old Testament.",

After the author's death, the work was finished (Romans through Revelation) by thirteen other nonconformist ministers, partly based upon notes taken by Henry's hearers, and edited by George Burder and John Hughes in 1811.\nMatthew Henry's commentaries are primarily exegetical, dealing with the scripture text as presented, with his prime intention being explanation, for practical and devotional purposes. While not being a work of textual research, for which Henry recommended Matthew Poole's Synopsis Criticorum, Henry's Exposition gives the result of a critical account of the original as of his time, with practical application. It was considered sensible and stylish, a commentary for devotional purposes.\nFamous evangelical Protestant preachers such as George Whitefield and Charles Spurgeon used and heartily commended the work, with Whitefield reading it through four times - the last time on his knees. Spurgeon stated, \"Every minister ought to read it entirely and carefully through once at least.\"\nHenry's reputation rests upon his renowned commentary, An Exposition of the Old and New Testaments (1708-10, known also as Matthew Henry's Commentary on the Whole Bible). He lived to complete it only as far as to the end of the Acts, but after his death other like-minded authors prepared the remainder from Henry's manuscripts. This work was long celebrated as the best English commentary for devotional purposes and the expanded edition was initially published in 1896. Instead of critical exposition, Henry focuses on practical suggestion, and his commentaries contains rich stores of truths.\nWe hope you will find this tool useful for your Bible Study!",

    "Kegel exercises make your pelvic floor muscles stronger. These muscles control your urine flow and help hold your pelvic organs in place.\nDoctors often prescribe Kegels for:\nStress incontinence . This means leaking urine when you laugh, cough, sneeze, jog, or lift something heavy.\nUrge incontinence . This is a need to urinate that is so strong you can't reach the toilet in time.\nPelvic floor weakness due to childbirth. Childbirth can stretch and weaken pelvic floor muscles. And that can cause urine control problems. It can also allow one or more pelvic organs to sag. When the uterus sags, it's called uterine prolapse. Women can help prevent this problem by doing daily Kegels during and after pregnancy.\nHow to do Kegel exercises\nKegels are easy to do and can be done anywhere without anyone knowing.\nFind the muscles you use to stop urinating.\nSqueeze these muscles for 3 seconds. Then relax for 3 seconds. Your stomach and thigh muscles should not tighten when you do this.\nAdd 1 second each week until you are able to squeeze for 10 seconds each time.\nRepeat this exercise 10 to 15 times per session. Try to do this at least 3 times a day.\nDon't do Kegels while you urinate. Doing them during urination can hurt your bladder.\nKegels work best when done on a regular schedule.\nYour doctor may want you to try doing Kegels with biofeedback. It lets you to see, feel, or hear when an exercise is being done correctly.\nTalk to your doctor if you don't notice improvement after doing Kegels for 3 or 4 months.",

If you do not grant these permissions Santa's Naughty List cannot work.\nHow to use Santa's Naughty List...\nThere are two modes of operation as an Adult (Parent) or as a Child.\nAs An Adult:\n1. Add your family and friends to the list of users.\n2. Tap a user from your list\n3. As an adult you can either Check the Naughty List or Report to the Naughty List...\n4. As an adult if you check the naughty list the app will check to see if they are on the list, a 'Random Add' to the list will NOT occur. if they are already on the list you can see why and ask Santa to be removed from the list (you have a 1 in three random chance you will not be removed by Santa but as an adult you have the choice)\n5. As an Adult you can report the person to Santa's Naughty List and detail what the bad deed was, you can then check the Naughty List as in step 4\nAs A Child\n1. Add your family and friends to the list of users.\n2. Tap a user from your list\n3. As a Child you can only Check the Naughty List...\n4. As a Child if you check the naughty list, the app will check to see if they are on the list, and if you are not on the list a 'Random Test' will NOT occur (1 chance in 5) you may be added to the list for a random reason. if they are already on the list you can see why and ask Santa to be removed from the list (you have a 1 in three random chance you will not be removed by Santa)\nThere is a One in Three chance they will be on the list anyhow and a one in three chance Santa will not take them off the list!\nPlease Note:\nSanta\u2019s Naughty List does not actually access any Servers this is make believe, just for fun and no data (Naughty List Names or Bad Deeds) are transmitted from or to your device.\nAny and all information is stored in an internal data file that is not share-able, sold or given to anyone.\nOh and No Ads either (I hate that on software designed to allow interaction with children)...\nIf you have any question, bug reports or anything you would like to see in a future version of the app please contact me at the email address at below.\nI do have some plans for an improved version for next Christmas...\nCredit where credit is due:\n\u2022\tApplication Icons: http://www.vectorss.com/icons/icon-set.html\n\u2022\tApplication Icons: http://www.webiconset.com/\n\u2022\tApplication Icons: http://www.iconeden.com/\n\u2022\tLump of Coal Vector: http://educlipsdesign.blogspot.co.uk/2014/11/a-lump-of-coal-for-christmas.html\n\u2022\tDevelopment Language: http://www.b4x.com/ B4A(Basic 4 Android)\nDeveloped and tested on:\nSamsung S3, Samsung S4, Samsung S5, Samsung Galaxy Tab3 8\u201d, Archos 7\u201d Tablet with Phone and GPS, Alcatel One Touch (4015X), Motorola Moto G Smart Phone\nSanta\u2019s Naughty List Copyright \u00a9 Steve McAnena 2014-2020\nsteve@mcanena.uk\nVisit the Facebook page for update details and up and coming features...\nhttps://www.facebook.com/santasnicelistapp/",

    "Universal taximeter for all.\nWe try to take into account all the possible tariffs, different calculation methods.\nIt is a tool for everyone. We are not trying to teach drivers how to work, we made a tool with which you can decide how to count the price of the trip in your taxi.\nIn the program when you first start sewn several tariffs for example, you can change them.\nThe tariff consists of a minimum cost, price range, travel time, waiting. The minimum cost can include time and distance, or one of them, which will end first.\nThe distance and time can be considered either together or \"one of\", with it you can set the \"minimum\" speed - is the rate below which it is considered that we are on the spot. Note that the minimum speed affects the joint count (when the speed is higher, the time does not count), so if you need to time and distance have always thought that place infinity.\nThe cost of kilometers and minutes can be set step by step, for example, from the start the kilometer costs $3, and after the 5th kilometer by $2.\nAt the end of the trip is given a detailed account of what is the price and can show the client what he pays as much.\nYou can configure additional services, which are paid by \"piece\" and on track to activate them. At the start as well as a tariff is a little list for example.\nMain feature of our taximeter - you can change the tariff on the go, such as starting the path in the city include the city, and you went out of town, you can switch to the country. Just keep in mind that when you change the tariff, not all parameters are changed, for example the parameters of \"minimal salary\" remain from the starting rate.\nIf you are having difficulty with your fare task - write to us. If you have a rate that we have not taken into account - write, we'll do our taximeter more versatile.\nDo not forget that you must have a device with GPS, otherwise it will be considered only time. If kilometers are not considered - first try to install special software for GPS testing that is complete here at the Market.\nTaximeter adapted for tablets - easy to work on the go. Also taxi drivers with the weakest devices will also be able to work, because the application is not demanding to resources, there is nothing superfluous.\nDesign can be customized - there skins (color themes), and font size.\nAvailable widget that appears on the special button when the taximeter is running and hanging on top of other windows.

    "This is the original 1611 King James Bible with Apocrypha\nNo internet connection needed.\nBible Reading Plan, Daily Verses, Notifications, Notes, Bookmarks and more!\nThe King James Bible is the most printed book in the history of the world. Any so-called \u201c1611\u201d King James Version you buy today at the local Christian Bookstore is absolutely NOT the 1611. .. it is the 1769 Baskerville Birmingham revision, even though it admits that nowhere, and may even say \u201c1611\u201d in the front\u2026 it\u2019s just not true. Prepare to be shocked! The spellings have been revised, and some words changed, in almost every printing done since 1769, and fourteen entire books plus extra prefatory features have been removed from almost every printing done since 1885!\nThe 1611 King James Bible was writen more than four hundred years ago when the English language was different. The original 1611 A.D. text, written in Early Modern English, shows the language in closer association with its Latin roots. Spelling was in Jacobean style which was not entirely standardized, but could be read phonetically. The original typeface was in Gothic style. Although both the typestyle and the older language may be considered difficult to read by some 21st Century English readers, the King James Version is recognized and respected for its beauty, cadence, and poetic feel.\nEnglish spelling differences in John 3:16\n- U = V (Example: loued = loved; gauve = gave)\n- y with 'e' above it was used as represent the 'thorn' character, which means 'the')\n- nn (Sonne = Son)\nOther spelling differences\n- V = U (Example: vnto = unto | See John 1:11)\n- VV = W (Example: svvord = sword) [The V was called a 'U', this is why we still call a W a 'double U']\n- I = J (Example: Iesus = Jesus | See John 1:17)\n- Long \"s\" letters look similar to \"f\" letters (Notice the 'Old Testament' type example on the right)\nPlease note:\nwe will not be able to save your current settings. Your bookmarks, font and others will not be saved. If it is very important to you, please consider this before updating this app.\nWe are strongly in need of your reviews grading this update.
